# Ethereum Block Explorer By Vashishth Patel

Let's put that knowledge to the test by building our very own **Ethereum Block Explorer**!

Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:
  * the blockchain network itself
  * blocks in the blockchain
  * transactions in a block
  * accounts
  * and many other things
  
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a good example of an Ethereum blockexplorer. Check it out to get familiar with how blockexplorers generally work.
